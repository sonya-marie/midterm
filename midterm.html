		<p><strong>Flour</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder "target=”_blank”>powder</a> made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_(grinding)"target=”_blank”>grinding</a> raw grains, roots, beans, nuts, or seeds. It is used to make many different foods. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal"target=”_blank”>Cereal</a> flour is the main ingredient of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread"target=”_blank”>bread</a>, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food"target=”_blank”>staple food</a> for most cultures. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_flour"target=”_blank”>Wheat flour</a> is one of the most important ingredients in <u>Oceanic,</u> <u>European,</u> <u>South American,</u> <u>North American,</u> <u>Middle Eastern,</u> <u>North Indian</u> and <u>North African cultures,</u> and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries.</p>

		<p>Wheat is the most common base for flour. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize"target=”_blank”>Corn</a> flour has been important in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica"target=”_blank”>Mesoamerican</a> cuisine since ancient times and remains a staple in the Americas. Rye flour is a constituent of bread in central Europe.</p>

		<p>Cereal flour consists either of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosperm"target=”_blank”>endosperm,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal_germ"target=”_blank”>germ,</a> and <a href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran"target=”_blank”>bran</a> together (whole-grain flour) or of the endosperm alone (refined flour).<i>Meal</i> is either differentiable from flour as having slightly coarser particle size (degree of comminution) or is synonymous with flour; the word is used both ways. For example, the word <i>cornmeal</i> often connotes a grittier texture whereas <i>corn</i> flour connotes fine powder, although there is no codified dividing line.</p>

		<h1 id="wwf">Whole-wheat Flour</h1>
		<p><strong>Whole-wheat flour</strong> (in the US) or <strong>whole meal flour</strong> (in the UK) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder "target=”_blank”>powdery</a> substance, a basic food ingredient, derived by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gristmill "target=”_blank”>grinding or mashing</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain "target=”_blank”>whole grain</a> of wheat, also known as the wheatberry. Whole-wheat flour is used in baking of breads and other baked goods, and also typically mixed with lighter "white" unbleached or bleached flours (that have been treated with flour bleaching agent(s) to restore nutrients (especially fiber, protein, and vitamins), texture, and body to the white flours that can be lost in milling and other processing to the finished baked goods or other food(s).</p>

		<h2 id="white_wheat">White Whole Wheat Flour</h2>
		<p>White whole-wheat flour is flour milled from hard white spring wheat, rather than traditional red wheat. In the United Kingdom and India, whole-wheat flour is more commonly made from white wheat instead of red as in the United States. The difference is that soft white wheat has a lower gluten content,and also lacks the tannins and phenolic acids that red wheat contains, causing white whole wheat to appear and taste more like refined red wheat; it is whitish in colour and does not taste bitter.

		White whole wheat has almost the same nutrient content as red whole wheat. However, soft white whole wheat has a lower gluten content and contains a lower protein content (between 9% and 11%) when compared with harder wheats like red (15–16% protein content) or golden wheat.</p>

		<h1 id="bleached">Bleached Flour</h1>
			<p>Main article: Flour bleaching agent
			"Bleached flour" is any refined flour with a whitening agent added. "Refined flour" has had the germ and bran removed and is typically referred to as "white flour".

			Bleached flour is artificially aged using a bleaching agent, a maturing agent, or both. A bleaching agent would affect only the carotenoids in the flour; a maturing agent affects gluten development. A maturing agent may either strengthen or weaken gluten development.</p>

		<h2 id="additives">Additives</h2>
			<p>The four most common additives used as bleaching/maturing agents in the US are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_bromate"target=”_blank”>Potassium bromate,</a> listed as an ingredient, is a maturing agent that strengthens gluten development. It does not bleach.</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoyl_peroxide"target=”_blank”>Benzoyl peroxide</a> bleaches, but does not act as a maturing agent. It has no effect on gluten.</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid"target=”_blank”>Ascorbic acid</a>  is listed as an ingredient, either as an indication that the flour was matured using ascorbic acid or that a small amount is added as a dough enhancer. It is a maturing agent that strengthens gluten development, but does not bleach.</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"target=”_blank”>Chlorine</a> gas is used as both a bleaching agent and a maturing agent. It weakens gluten development and oxidizes starches, making it easier for the flour to absorb water and swell, resulting in thicker batters and stiffer doughs. The retarded gluten formation is desirable in cakes, cookies, and biscuits, as it would otherwise make them tougher and bread-like. The modification of starches in the flour allows the use of wetter doughs (making for a moister end product) without destroying the structure necessary for light, fluffy cakes and biscuits.[10] Chlorinated flour allows cakes and other baked goods to set faster and rise better, and the fat to be distributed more evenly, with less vulnerability to collapse.</li></ul>

				<p>Some other chemicals used as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_treatment_agents"target=”_blank”>flour treatment agents</a> to modify color and baking properties include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_dioxide"target=”_blank”>Chlorine dioxide</a>(unstable to be transported in the U.S.)</li>
					<li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_peroxide" target=”_blank”>Calcium peroxide</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azodicarbonamide"target=”_blank”>Azodicarbonamide</a>or azobisformamide (synthetic)</li>
					<li>Atmospheric oxygen causes natural bleaching.</li>

				<h2 id="foa">Frequency of Additives</h2>
					<p>Cake flour in particular is nearly always chlorinated. At least one flour labeled "unbleached cake flour blend" (marketed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur_Flour"target=”_blank”>King Arthur Flour</a>) is not bleached, but the protein content is much higher than typical cake flour at about 9.4% protein (cake flour is usually around 6% to 8%). According to King Arthur, this flour is a blend of a more finely milled unbleached wheat flour and cornstarch, which makes a better end result than unbleached wheat flour alone (cornstarch blended with all-purpose flour is commonly substituted for cake flour when the latter is unavailable). The end product, however, is denser than would result from lower-protein, chlorinated cake flour.</p>

					<p>All bleaching and maturing agents (with the possible exception of ascorbic acid) have been banned in the United Kingdom.</p>

					<p>Bromination of flour in the US has fallen out of favor, and while it is not yet actually banned anywhere, few retail flours available to the home baker are bromated anymore.</p>

					<p>Many varieties of flour packaged specifically for commercial bakeries are still bromated. Retail bleached flour marketed to the home baker is now treated mostly with either peroxidation or chlorine gas. Current information from Pillsbury is that their varieties of bleached flour are treated both with benzoyl peroxide and chlorine gas. Gold Medal states that their bleached flour is treated either with benzoyl peroxide or chlorine gas, but no way exists to tell which process has been used when buying the flour at the grocery store.</p>
